pl find attached the corrected files (prakash2d_new.for and

update_ptmodel_new.for). I have commented the places with initials RN

wherein I have introduced changes in the code.

 I have also included an input file along with a fortran file 

plscomp_mp01.for to use MP01 macro and set initial values of internal

variables and BCs. A sample input file fpin_plscomp.dat is also included

for running plane strain compression of a bar with perturbed cohesion

value (see cohes.dat). This will simulate multiple shear bands during

plane strain compression of a bar. This problem was studied by Prakash in

his latest JMPS paper. Note the units used for modeling in the input file

(including stress, elastic modulus etc.) is nanometers and NOT meteres or

milli meters. By simulating different sizes for the bar (with respect to

the free volume diffusion length scale) you can see the effect on shear

band formation. You can try this problem with and without temperature

evolution (isothermal and coupled case) after you have debugged the code

with 1 element tests. For 1 element tests in addition to plane strain

compression, also run simple shear and uniaxial compression (for this you

have to use 1 axisymm element and shut off the diffusion term in free

volume and temperature evolution).

 BTW for axisymm case we need to take a look at the grad term and

Laplacian term closely.
