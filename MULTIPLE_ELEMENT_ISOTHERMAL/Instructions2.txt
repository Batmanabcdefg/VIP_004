Attached are above files. If you give

PLOT             100

you should get data for plotting contours of temperature, free volume, log
plastic strain and cohesion (ql(6), ql(8), log(lamda_1^p) and ql(22)) in
tecplt2.dat.

 Please do systematic analysis of foll:

With 1 element run:

a) Plane strain compression
b) uniaxial compression (axisymm element)
c) Simple shear (plane strain)

 In all above cases suppress free volume diffusion (se s_1 = 0) and heat
conduction (set k_th = 0). Do the above corresponding to three cases
 1) Isothermal
 2) Isoconfigurational (constant free vol)
 3) Coupled case (both temp and free volume can evolve)


 Do the above corresponding 3 temperatures and plot strss-strain, free
vol-strain, temp-strain. Indrasen has developed a matlab code for getting
solutions to simple shear problem. Pl discuss with him and see if you can
compare your results with him.

Do not send me individual jpg files. You can show me the results in the
lab or send me a ppt file of results.

 After throughly analyzing above problmes we can run multiple shear
banding under plane strain compression and simple shear - refer to MP01
file and mesh generation files I sent you earlier.

 PS: I noted that after reaching peak stress in plane strain compression
(1 elem), the stress state becomes inhomogeneous (i.e., varies from Gauss
point to Gauss point). This happens for both isothermal and coupled
cases. We need to understand why this happens and also check if this
happens for isoconfigurational case.
